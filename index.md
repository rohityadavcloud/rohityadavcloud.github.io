[Namaste](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namaste)! I'm Rohit Yadav, CTO at
[ShapeBlue](https://www.shapeblue.com/about/).

I'm a long-time [PMC member](http://people.apache.org/committer-index.html#rohit)
and [committer](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/graphs/contributors) of the
opensource <span class="logo acs">&nbsp;</span> [Apache CloudStack](http://cloudstack.apache.org)
project, working on it since 2012. I'm also a
[member of the Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/foundation/members).

I've served as the [release
manager](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/releases) for several CloudStack releases,
and authored several CloudStack flagship features, frameworks and tools such as
[cmk](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-cloudmonkey),
[mbx](https://github.com/shapeblue/mbx), the CloudStack
[UI](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/tree/main/ui) (originally started as project
[Primate](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-primate)) and many others. I wrote the opensource
CloudStack developer onboarding course [hackerbook](https://github.com/shapeblue/hackerbook)
and I regularly speak at CloudStack and related events, meetups and conferences. I also organise
and chair the CloudStack India User Group (CSIUG) meetups across destinations in India. Nowadays,
I’ve transitioned into a mentoring and leadership role both in the community and at work.

My [GPG key](/gpg.pub) is [0x0EE3D884](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?search=0x5ED1E1122DC5E8A4A45112C2484248210EE3D884&fingerprint=on&op=index), full fingerprint of my key is: `5ED1 E112 2DC5 E8A4 A451 12C2 4842 4821 0EE3 D884`.

My interest and journey in the cloud computing space started at CERN in 2010, where
I got hands-on experience in virtualisation and cloud computing as a volunteer
summer student working with my mentor Dr. [Ben Segal](https://www.internethalloffame.org/inductee/ben-segal).
Working on Apache CloudStack has enabled me to work in several areas of interest and domains
such as virtualisation, networking, storage, distributed systems, orchestration, resource management and scheduling,
and leadership.
